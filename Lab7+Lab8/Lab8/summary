I learned a lot about the FAT12 file system throughout both of these labs. There was a lot of tedious work to be done in these labs when it came to bitwise operations and manipulating strings at a low-level. I definitley refreshed my skills with C strings and memory leaks. Before this lab, I didn't know a lot about how the Unix file system is structured. This lab gave a great overview of that and had us working at nearly the lowest level possible.
