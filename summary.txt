The main thing I learned in this project is how to use threads and child processes in the C language. It was also interesting to understand how a C program works with the process table and to understand what happens when a new child process is created. I learned that manual pages are one of the most useful things in the Linux operating system. It is very neat to be able to replicate a shell program, run the program, make changes from within the shell, make the project again, and finally run a new instance of the shell so that the process table now has two running shell programs. It really helped me to think of how an actual operating system works, spinning off different proceses to run commands in parallel.   

This was also my first experience running shell commands from somewhere other than the command-line. I learned a lot about the Linux filesystem and where most of the executable files are located. I also began torecollect some of my C knowledge. It was interesting having to build a complex string replace function when almost all other languages has a very standard way to perform a string replace. I performed string manipulation when replacing the '~' and 'home' strings with the actual path to the home directory. This required new allocation of memory especially since the user could type something such as '~/308'. I am looking forward to learn all about the potential uses for child processes and multi-programming.
